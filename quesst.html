NASA's aeronautical innovators are leading a government-industry team to collect data that could make supersonic flight over land possible, dramatically reducing travel time in the UnitedStatesor anywhere in the world.

The Quesst mission has two goals: 
1) design and build NASAâ€™s X-59 research aircraft with technology that reduces the loudness of a sonic boom to a gentle thump to people on the ground; and 
2) fly the X-59 over several U.S. communities to gather data on human responses to the sound generated during supersonic flight and deliver that data set to U.S. and international regulators.</p>

Using this data, new sound-based rules regarding supersonic flight over land can be written and adopted,which would open the doors to new commercial cargo and passenger markets to provide faster-than-sound air travel.

Elements of NASA's Quesst mission are organized within two of the agency's aeronautics programs -- theAdvanced Air Vehicles Program and the Integrated Aviation Systems Program -- and managed by a systems
project office whose members span both programs and all four of NASA's aeronautical research field centers:Langley Research Center in Virginia; Glenn Research Center in Cleveland; and 
Ames Research Center and Armstrong Flight Research Center, which are both located in California.
