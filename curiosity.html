The Mars Perseverance rover mission is part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic exploration 
of the Red Planet. The Mars Perseverance mission addresses high-priority science goals for Mars exploration, including key 
questions about the potential for life on Mars. The mission takes the next step by not only seeking signs of habitable 
conditions on Mars in the ancient past, but also searching for signs of past microbial life itself. The Mars Perseverance 
rover introduces a drill that can collect core samples of the most promising rocks and soils and set them aside in a "cache" 
on the surface of Mars. </p>

The mission also provides opportunities to gather knowledge and demonstrate technologies that address the challenges of 
future human expeditions to Mars. These include testing a method for producing oxygen from the Martian atmosphere, 
identifying other resources (such as subsurface water), improving landing techniques, and characterizing weather, dust, 
and other potential environmental conditions that could affect future astronauts living and working on Mars.
